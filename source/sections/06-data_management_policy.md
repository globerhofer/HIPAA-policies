# 6. Data Management Policy

WayToHealth has procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of electronic protected health information (ePHI) utilizing our Backup Service. This policy, and associated procedures for testing and restoring from backup data apply generally to all WayToHealth Customers excepting those Customers that do not choose or opt-out of the WayToHealth Backup Service. The policy and procedures will assure that complete, accurate, retrievable, and tested backups are available for all Customers using WayToHealth.

Data backup is an important part of the day-to-day operations of WayToHealth. To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI, both for WayToHealth and WayToHealth Customers, complete backups are done daily to assure that data remains available when it is needed and in case of a disaster.

Violation of this policy and its procedures by workforce members may result in corrective disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment per UPHS policies.
